Absolutely, Sagar. Since you already have a solid grasp of Python theory, let‚Äôs shift gears and walk through a real-world development workflow‚Äîthe kind you'd encounter as a Python developer in industry. I‚Äôll break it down into step-by-step phases, each with practical guidance and curated video resources to deepen your hands-on experience.

üß≠ Step-by-Step Python Development Workflow (Industry Style)
1. Environment Setup & Tooling
Before writing code, professionals set up isolated environments and configure their IDEs for productivity.
- ‚úÖ Use venv or conda for environment isolation.
- ‚úÖ Configure VS Code with linters, formatters, and debugger.
Watch: Enhancing Your Python Workflow: Environment Management ...
This video walks you through creating environments, shell integration, and debugging setup in VS Code‚Äîexactly how pros streamline their dev setup.

2. Project Structure & Version Control
A clean, modular project structure is key. You‚Äôll also use Git for version control.
- ‚úÖ Organize code into folders: src/, tests/, docs/
- ‚úÖ Use .gitignore, README.md, and requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ Push to GitHub and manage branches

This gives a high-level view of production-grade Python projects, including pipelines, performance monitoring, and tool integration.

3. Real-World Use Case: Automation & ETL
Industry projects often involve automating tasks or building data pipelines.
- ‚úÖ Write Python scripts to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data
- ‚úÖ Schedule jobs using GitHub Actions or cron
Watch: Automating Data Pipelines with Python & GitHub Actions ...
This tutorial shows how to automate ETL workflows using Python and GitHub Actions‚Äîperfect for backend or data engineering roles.

4. Domain-Specific Applications
Depending on your industry, Python is used in automation, VFX, CAD, or industrial control systems.
- ‚úÖ For automation: use pyserial, modbus, or OPC-UA
- ‚úÖ For VFX or CAD: integrate with tools like Houdini or Pixyz Studio

üîß What You Can Build (Hands-On Ideas)
- A CLI tool to automate Excel billing (like you‚Äôve done before)
- A Django REST API for student management
- A GitHub Action that runs tests and pushes deployment
- A Python script that reads sensor data and logs it to a database

üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps for You
Let‚Äôs pick one of these tracks and build it together. I‚Äôll guide you through the code, structure, and deployment. Want to start with a GitHub Action that automates a Python script? Or maybe a Django API with modular views and serializers?
You‚Äôre already thinking like a developer‚Äînow let‚Äôs build like one.
